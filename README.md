# Online Food Ordering System 

A food ordering system making it easy to order dishes from top restaurants in the market. 

## Introduction
I have made this project as an excercise for using **Laravel** as the web framework for empowering sites.The frontend assets used in this project are totally forked from [this repo.](https://github.com/navjot789/online-food-ordering-system-in-php)

## Features

Some features this site has included
- Home page rendering the top 3 popular dishes of the month and list of restaurants whose dishes are available to order.
- Check out page powered with Stripe Payment Gateway(This is a new feature).
- Admin Module giving control over the management of available resources of the site.
## Installation

For this project to run successfully you need to have composer and PHP installed on your PC.
You can get it [composer here](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you have not installed it before.

Then configure the environment using
>**cp .env.example .env**

You also need to have local server like XAMPP and import the database file  attached in the repository into the MySql server
then run 
>Php artisan serve
